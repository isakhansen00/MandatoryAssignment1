# MandatoryAssignment1
Repository for mandatory assignment 1 in FYS-2021

This is the first mandatory assignment in the FYS-2021 Machine Learning course taught at UiT The Arctic University of Norway. I will be solving three problems ranging from some data pre-processing using pandas and numpy and present the results from that in problem 1. Furthermore in problem 2 I will be implementing a classifier from scratch using logistic regression and train it with the data i have prepared in the previous problem. In the same problem i will also be testing the classifier with the test set and compare the accuracy between the train and test set. In problem 3 I will be creating a confusion matrix based on the classification of the test set
